## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

In this challenge I learned a little more how to use grid and flex layout in the same project. It was difficult at first because I had to decide wich layout should be the best to each section.

### Continued development

I have to build more projects with grid and flexbox, and I think It's time to start learning about sass.
